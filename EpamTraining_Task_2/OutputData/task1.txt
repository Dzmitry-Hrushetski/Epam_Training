The if-then and if-then-else Statements 
The output from the program is : 
Omitting them can make the code more brittle . 
One possible implementation of the applyBrakes method could be as follows : 
Deciding when to omit the braces is a matter of personal taste . 
The if-then statement is the most basic of all the control flow statements . 
The compiler cannot catch this sort of error you'll just get the wrong results . 
The if-then-else statement provides a secondary path of execution when an "if" clause evaluates to false . 
In addition , the opening and closing braces are optional , provided that the "then" clause contains only one statement : 
In this case , the action is to simply print an error message stating that the bicycle has already stopped . 
However , once a condition is satisfied , the appropriate statements are executed (grade = 'C' ) and the remaining conditions are not evaluated . 
If a second statement is later added to the "then" clause , a common mistake would be forgetting to add the newly required braces . 
You may have noticed that the value of testscore can satisfy more than one expression in the compound statement : 76 >= 70 and 76 >= 60 . 
The following program , IfElseDemo , assigns a grade based on the value of a test score : an A for a score of 90% or above , a B for a score of 80% or above , and so on .
